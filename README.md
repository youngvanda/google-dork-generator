# Google Dork Generator
My Handy Google Dorks for Hunting/Pentesting. I personally collected these Google Dorks from reading write-ups, other hunters' Tweets and experiences. So don't just rely on these dorks add them gradually to your DB.  

# Installation

```
apt install apache2
cd /var/www/html/
