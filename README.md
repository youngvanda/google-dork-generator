# Google Dork Generator
A handy collection of Google Dorks for Reconnaissance, Penetration Testing, and Bug Bounty Hunting.

I’ve gathered these dorks from write-ups, fellow hunters’ tweets, and my own experience in the field. Think of this as a solid starting point — not the final database. Keep experimenting, discovering new dorks, and growing your own collection.
